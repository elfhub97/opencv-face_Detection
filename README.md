# opencv-face_Detection
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human
## Face recognition
The basic idea of face recognition is based on the geometric features of a face. It is the feasible and most intuitive approach for face recognition. The first automated face recognition system was described in the position of eyes, ears, nose. These positioning points are called features vector (distance between the points).

The face recognition is achieved by calculating the Euclidean distance between feature vectors of a probe and reference image. This method is effective in illumination change by its nature, but it has a considerable drawback. The correct registration of the maker is very hard
